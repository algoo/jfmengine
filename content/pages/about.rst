I am Jonathan Tremesaygues, a thirty-something ramdom guy writing code for a living. I live in Montpellier (France) and do stuff like cooking, reading, playing table top games, riding a bike in the country side or climbing.

I am a Libre and open-source enthusiast since my ~15. Thank to jujun<, I've discovered Linux and Python in high school. Since, I mostly use opensource OS softwares whenever I can. My main computer run Arch Linux, this server is powered by <del>OpenBSD &lt;&percnt;</del> Ubuntu and my FairPhone use LineageOS without the Google&apos;s craps.

Since my reading of The Circle by D. Eggers, I have deleted most of my GAFAM accounts. This book is terrifying! I think that everybody should read it. There are always these 2 GMail addresses, &apos;cause it&apos;s hard to update everywhere… But maybe one day!
